Adventure: Open source RPG
==============================================

* Authors: Ryan Bateman

Description
-----------

The intention of this project was to build a game engine that allowed other developers to build out the game level by level.  Basically a tree where different people are designing each branch.

Choices would be like this:
Level 1 -> Level 2-A -> Level 3-A-A
                     -> Level 3-A-B
           Level 2-B -> Level 3-B-A
                     -> Level 3-B-B

and so on...  Some branches would just be abandoned and the user would have to roll their game back.

It was meant to practice canvas, etc.  It's been mostly abandoned.
